# Shopee Product Recommendations

This is a simple static website showcasing product recommendations with category tabs, search filtering, and product detail modals.

## Setup

- The project consists of `index.html` and an `images` folder containing product images.
- Make sure to add your product images inside the `images` folder.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push this project to the repository root.
2. Ensure the `index.html` and `images` folder are included in the repository.
3. Go to the repository on GitHub.
4. Click on **Settings** > **Pages**.
5. Under **Source**, select the branch (e.g., `main`) and root folder (`/`).
6. Click **Save**.
7. After a few moments, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

## Notes

- The site is fully static and requires no backend.
- Use relative paths for images as in the `images` folder.
- To add new products, update the `products` array in `index.html`.

Enjoy your Shopee product recommendations site!
